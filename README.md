# TAGALOG/ENG November 2023 I.T. Career Advice: Interview Strategies [the real talk way] by [Medyo No](https://www.facebook.com/MedyoSocial/)
<details><summary>A long note</summary>
<p>Almost all of you won’t be able to name an I.T. engineer who only worked for one company throughout his career because every successful I.T. engineer would have worked for multiple companies before being successful. To be able to work for multiple employers you have to be capable of landing a job and to be able to land a job you have to surpass the interview process. That’s how important interviews are. In our industry it’s not all about skills and tech at hindi lang isang interview ang dadaanan mo sa career mo.</p>
  
<p>With that said, here is my November I.T. Career Advice: Interview Strategies [the real talk way]</p>
  
<p>Tip # 1: If you don’t know how to prepare for a job interview read the job description of the role you are applying. If you don’t have it then search the job portals for that role, read through 20 postings, and then understand the common denominators of that role (skills required, day to day responsibilities, and technologies used). Focus your preparation on those three.</p>
<p>Tip # 2: If you have a meeting invite for your interview (ask if you don’t) pull the names of the people on the invite and Google them. See if they have a LinkedIn profile or if you can find them on-line. Research their past roles and job history. Knowing who will be on the call will tell you how the interview will go. Obviously kung meron mga engineers sa call then expect the interview to have technical questions, kung HR or recruiter then it will be more about your background, career, and compatibility to the company. Kung upper I.T. management or final interview sa boss ng magiging boss mo then be ready to sell your personality and communication skills. Kung si hiring manager heavy ang technical background at newbie manager pa lang then be ready na tapunan ka rin nya ng technical questions, pero kung nasa management na sya for a very long time then you may be able to B.S. your way about your technical skills. Meron din ibang diskarte kung maliit or malaki ang company at kung anong industry sya, although medyo advanced tips na yun for me to share here.</p>
<p>Tip # 3: Don’t be shy to ask your recruiter or HR about the person or people conducting your interview. Recruiters will gladly give you some tips. Ask questions like “How does this person/people conduct their interviews?”, “Have there been candidates before me that completed the same interview and how did those go?”, “What are the typical questions being asked?”, etc. Kung magaling recruiter mo he/she should be able to answer all those questions.</p>
<p>Tip # 4: For technologies you are not familiar with get a good understanding of what they are 2-3 hours before the interview. Find out about version numbers, get a good look and feel of the product’s interface, common problems with it, competing products, etc. It’s much better to sell yourself na you have a good working knowledge about the technology despite the lack of hands-on experience than to simply say you don’t know what it is. Else, kung hindi mo talaga alam don’t be scared to say na hindi mo alam. Mas ok yun kesa magpanggap ka na alam mo dahil ang mangyayari lang is paligoy-ligoy ka sa sagot mo and interviewers will definitely see through that.</p>
<p>Tip # 5: I have a 49-inch widescreen monitor that I use solely for interviews. On that screen are all of my notes for the interview including answers to the most common interview questions I have gathered for the role I am targeting. My camera is pointed to my face but in an angle and not directly to my eyes. Sa simula pa lang ng interview I stare at my notes na agad and don’t look at the camera directly. This gives the interviewers the impression that I am looking at them through my screen but in reality I am looking at my notes and am only glancing on them. This way pag may tinanong sakin na hindi ko completely alam and I have to refer to my notes hindi halata na may binabasa ako.</p>
<p>Tip # 6: Have a template of perfectly crafted answers to the most common personality questions or questions that you know may be asked because they are red flags on your resume, like “Why did you leave your last job” or “Explain the gap on your resume”. Know how to respond to questions like “Where do you want to be or where do you see yourself 5 years from now” or “Tell me a time when you had to deal with a huge problem and how you managed to resolve it”.</p>
<p>I hop a lot and sometimes I get asked why I hop a lot. Companies ask that kasi ayaw nila na papasok ako tapos aalis din naman ako in a short period of time. Ang sagot ko lagi dun is “I wanted to learn a lot and I wanted to work at different environments and industries. That helped me tremendously in my career and brought to me to where I am now. However, I just started my own family recently and am a father now. Priorities have changed so I am now looking for a stable company that I can grow with for a long period of time, and I feel this company meets that requirement” – kahit hindi naman totoo na nag ka anak ako at alam ko na lilipat ulit ako after two years or less.</p>
<p>Tip # 7: Go through plenty of rejections. I’ve learned to master the strategy on how to talk to recruiters and HR, hiring managers, engineers, and what to say and not to say on technical interviews, final interviews, personality interviews, initial screening, etc. because I always put myself through interviews. Yung notes ko na sinabi ko sa Tip # 5 were notes collected from decades’ worth of interviews. By going through it over and over again you will naturally be able to predict how an interview will go and can easily prepare for it, even to a point na kaya mo na i-set ang tone and direction ng interview kahit ikaw yung applicant.</p>
<p>There is no step by step process to successfully pass an interview. Interviews are mastered through confidence, confidence is achieved through experience, and experience is collected through tons and tons of rejections. Experience countless number of rejections para mas maintindihan mo yung job hiring process at para ma build mo ang confidence mo.</p>
<p>Tip # 8: Kahit hindi ka naghahanap ng work just go out there and test the market. Get a feel how marketable you are or how hard it is for you to land a job para may idea ka in case mawalan ka ng work. Test the market para malaman mo kung underpaid ka ba sa skills na meron ka or overpaid ka. Di mo naman kailangan lumipat if you don’t want to e. At the end of the day it is always better to be rejecting job offers than to be rejected for a role. Kung stress ka na sa work mo or feeling mo toxic sya, kahit di ka pa naman nagplaplano mag quit maghanap ka na ng work para malaman mo kung may karapatan ka ba mag quit dahil kayang-kaya mo kumuha ng kapalit o kung dapat ka muna kumuha ng kapalit bago ka mag quit. The side effect to embracing endless job search is gagaling ka na rin sa interviews naturally.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to leave your comfort zone at ok ka lang sa company mo then hanap ka ng mga work na 50K more sa kinikita mo at mas senior sa role na meron ka. Apply ka ng apply at pag daanan mo ang mga application and interview process. Ang goal mo lang naman is to gain experience sa mga interviews e so kung di mo man makuha mga roles na yun then ok lang, pero kung biglang ginulat mo sarili mo dahil nakalusot ka, well, then meron kang napakagandang problema.</p>
<p>Tip # 9: Going through countless interviews taught me that it’s not about my qualifications but about selling myself sa mga nag-iinterview sakin. Maraming beses na ko nakalusot sa mga interviews not because I am qualified for the role but because I was able to sell myself to the hiring manager. If you can get to that point sa career mo na kaya mo na benta sarili mo successfully then you will never have to worry about job security ever again nor will you ever have to worry about a low salary.</p>
<p>Tip # 10: Never ever deny yourself of an opportunity to go through the job hiring process. When recruiters reach out to you or may nag refer sayo kahit hindi ka naman naghahanap entertain them and go through the hiring process. Maraming beses ko na na-ecounter na nasa interview ako for one role tapos inofferan ako ng ibang role with a much bigger pay than the one I am targeting dahil nakausap nila ako at nalaman nila skill sets ko. There were times din na alam ko na hindi ko naman kukunin yung work pero pinatulan ko pa rin para lang ma experience yung interview process tapos in the end I ended up getting the job anyway kasi sobrang ganda nung final offer versus sa initial understanding ko about the work and salary. These are unexpected opportunities na di ko naman malalaman kung tinanggihan ko na agad sa inquiry pa lang.</p>
<p>I am both an employee and employer. Once in a while I go to the job boards and look for talent to work for me. I look for experienced engineers who I feel are underpaid and I give them an opportunity to move up sa career at buhay nila. Lagi ako nakaka encounter ng mga engineers who flat out decline a role without even asking for more information. One of the responses I always get is “I am currently employed”. If only they knew that the salary they would get from me is at least double of what they are currently making and that what I have to offer will allow them to experience different roles and exposure sa ibat-ibang fields sa I.T., get to touch countless of technologies, and work at different industries. Don’t be that kind of engineer – pag may tumawag sayo or may nag refer sayo for a role kahit hindi ka interested pag daanan mo yung process – because again, in our industry it’s not all about skills and tech lang.</p>
